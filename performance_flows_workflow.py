I received your query: "{query}"

This is a placeholder response from the Performance/Flows react agent workflow. 

To integrate the actual workflow:
1. Replace this function with calls to the Performance/Flows system
2. Handle any image outputs they might generate
3. Ensure proper error handling

The Performance/Flows system should return both text and optionally image data."""
